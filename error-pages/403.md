# You're a bit nosy aren't you

It seems you have wandered off the beaten track and Robo, your personal robot, can't (won't) allow you to proceed. If you would like to look under the hood feel free to check out the repo of this Jekyll build <a href="https://github.com/madeslowly/GaitQ">here</a>. Otherwise, head back home <a href="{{ site.url }}">here</a> or <a href="javascript:history.back()">go back</a>.
