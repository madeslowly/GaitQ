# This config file contains settings that affect your entire site, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely need to edit after that.
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# `bundle exec jekyll s`. If you change this file, restart the server process.
# Building for production use `JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll b`
#
# bundle install if running for first time.
