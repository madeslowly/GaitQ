This folder contains all original content provided by GaitQ/OCW/Made Slowly.

This folder and it's content is completely ignored by Jekyll and will never appear in our built site. Do not point to anything here. When we want to use an image from here, copy it to the appropriate folder, ie images/content/ and call from there. Jekyll will take the image and generate the source set need for responsive images.
