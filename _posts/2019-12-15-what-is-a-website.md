A common hurdle for people getting a new website is understanding what exactly they are getting and more importantly, what they actually need. Defining what is a website is a bit like trying to define what a vehicle is. Sure there are many common features of every website but there are literally thousands of variations that are suited to different situations. You don't need a tractor to pick up the kids from school.

## Beyond your browser

When you view a website on your device, you are using software to interpret instructions to 'paint' a page on your screen. But before we even get here there are a lot of previous things that have happened, and understanding the basics is a great way to make an informed decision on what type of website you need.

### In the beginning there was a connection

So without being silly, we can start at the beginning. If one computer had a physical cable stretching to another computer, you could send a message asking to be sent a picture for example.

Many of the protocols developed during the early days of the internet still exist today and at the core, the internet is essentially one computer making requests to another computer.

Ok, we have 2 computers talking to each other and this is where our first major difference between websites can be understood. A simple website written in programming languages that are entirely interpreted by the receiving computer. The sending computer does literally just that, it sends the files you request. Got it? Some websites are written in languages that are interpreted on the sending computer, after which, the requested files are sent.

## Static vs dynamic websites

A static website is our simple website mentioned above, it is a collection of files that live on a remote computer. And when requested, they are sent in their raw form. A dynamic website, you guessed it, is built when a request is received, then the raw files are sent.

This important difference means a lot to you. One is cheaper than the other, and one has some big advantages over the other. A static website is easier to build and is then cheaper to build, but to change it, you need a developer or some software enabling you to edit the raw files of a website.

The other type of website, requires more advanced programming and as such will cost a little more, but because the website is built on the server, that's the computer that sends the files, we can use software that runs on the server, allowing non-developers to easily change and control their content. This sort of website software is often referred to as Content Management System (CMS). The negative, there is one, is that these types of websites contain a LOT of code. Seriously, take this website for example, it is a static website, which results in faster loading times and has a much smaller footprint on the server.

## What type of website do you need

If you are creating website that won't need regular updating and you are happy to leave that to a developer then a static website is the best choice. They are lightweight in terms of their computational footprint, almost 100% secure and they tend to cost a bit less.

For the more demanding of you out there that want to have more control and plan to regularly update their website, then you need to take it on the chin and pay that little bit extra to have a dynamic.
